In each forder, the command to run the test is in test/test.sh

Test cases:

10 pts: Requesting a file that lives on a single sender through a single emulator.  

10 pts: Requesting a file that lives on a single sender through multiple emulators.

10 pts: Requesting a file that is split among 2 different senders through a single emulator.

10 pts: Requesting a file that is split among 2 different senders through different emulators.

10 pts: Requesting a file that is split among 2 different senders, ensuring that packet delays are correctly implemented

10 pts: Requesting a file that is split among 2 different senders with a relatively small queue size in the emulator (expecting some packet drops, looking for correct emulator behavior and correct sender retransmission)

                                                                     
10 pts: Requesting a file that is split among 2 different senders, testing for correct packet loss rate implementation in the emulator

10 pts: Requesting a file that is split among 2 different senders, testing for correct packet priority implementation

10 pts: Requesting a file that is split among 3 different senders through a single emulator.

10 pts: Correct logging information for above testing cases.
